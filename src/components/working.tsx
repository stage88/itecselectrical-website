                  <p className='u-text u-text-font u-text-4'>
                    The use of electrical appliances is an integral part of functioning in everyday life. Ensuring appliances function
                    correctly, efficiently and are free from fault is essential to reducing harm and severe injury to users. As a fully
                    certified electrical contractor, ITECS Electrical Services (ITECS) can recommend and install a number of essential
                    measures to reduce the risk to users.

                  <p className='u-text u-text-font u-text-4'>
                    Firstly, safety switches monitor and subsequently turn off power within 0.03 of a second should it detect a fault.
                    Secondly, ensuring switchboards are correctly mounted and free from obstructions provides quick and easy access and the
                    necessary protection of your property. Thirdly, all power and lighting circuits should be sufficiently protected.
                    Finally, older properties may also require a switchboard upgrade and the installation of necessary safety switches (see
                    Switchboard Upgrade section for further information).

                    Given the wide variety of lighting technology available today, our designs use the most energy-efficient products, to
                    ensure long-term savings on energy bills. Furthermore, many energy companies offer competitive prices and substantial
                    rebates to incentivize customers to use more environmentally friendly energy products.

                  <p className='u-text u-text-font u-text-4'>
                    ITECS works directly with clients to ensure to produce a brief for the site to be assessed. This may be based upon
                    purely energy saving, quality of light and hence enhanced customer experience, there will be an initial energy
                    assessment of the existing installation with supportive real-time monitoring. ITECS will then consult with the client to
                    produce a lighting design and calculation conforming to Part L (2013) Compliance including the LENI calculation
                    standards. Upon contractual agreement implementation of the project proposal will commence.

                    so selecting and utilizing the right products and technology is critical to controlling your budget and reducing future
                    energy costs.
